
Part 1:

	1. Control flags are bits that determine the ouput of the control unit,
	so that the processor knows what to do next. These control flags are typically
	fed in from the previous stage, giving the control ouputs for the next stage.
	
	2. a_inv, b_inv, alu_op, write_enable.
	
Part 2:

	1. END IF;
	
	2. If you only want to update values at specific times, your control unit
	needs to be sequential.
	
	3. IF(rising_edge(Clock)) THEN...
	
	4. 
	...Process(clock, reset)
		BEGIN
		  IF(reset = '1') THEN
			output <= (OTHERS =>'0');
		  ELSIF(rising_edge(Clock)) THEN
			IF(x = "01") THEN
			  y <= "00";
			ELSIF(x = "10") THEN
			  y <= "01";
			ELSE
			  y <= "00";
			END IF;
		  END IF;
		END PROCESS;
		...
		
Part 3:

	1. Registry files for accessing values, and the ALU for computing.
	
	2. 10
	
	3. When reset = 1, the stage is set back to 0 in order to start a new instruction.
	
	4. The write enable control signal is set in stage 5.
